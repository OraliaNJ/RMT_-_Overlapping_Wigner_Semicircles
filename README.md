# RMT_And_Overlapping_Wigner_Semicircles
/*

In this proposal we apply a unique methodology of random matrix theory in the moments of a probability measure that appears as the limit of the empirical spectral distribution by the Overlapping Wigner semicircle law.

The study period runs from April 12 to October 5, 2020 (761 665 Patients).

This method presents a regional analysis of COVID-19 in Mexico. Due to the comorbidities of Mexican society, the new pandemic implies a higher risk for the population.

The figure A_Mob.jpg describes the Asthma morbidity analysis in the 5 regions of Mexico divided by hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients who tested positive to COVID-19 in the 176 days of analysis.

Note: The programming language is scripting and I select Octave for its implemantation.
